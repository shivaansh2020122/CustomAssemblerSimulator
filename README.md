# CustomAssemblerSimulator

This repository is a course project for Computer Organization course done during Winter semester 2021, in IIITD.

## How To Run
Once you have added the code inside your files add the bash commands to run them inside the run files present inside both [SimpleSimulator](https://github.com/shivaansh2020122/CustomAssemblerSimulator/tree/master/SimpleSimulator "SimpleSimulator") and [Simple-Assembler](https://github.com/shivaansh2020122/CustomAssemblerSimulator/tree/master/Simple-Assembler "Simple-Assembler") 
Once you have done so on a linux terminal move to the [automatedTesting](https://github.com/shivaansh2020122/CustomAssemblerSimulator/tree/master/automatedTesting "automatedTesting") folder inside and run the run file using ./run
This will evaluate the correctness of the code based on the ISA described in the pdf. 
>The folder named [oldautomatedTesting](https://github.com/shivaansh2020122/CustomAssemblerSimulator/tree/master/oldautomatedTesting "oldautomatedTesting") can be used for less rigorous testing. It cover lesser complex and number of test cases.>

- To evaluate only the assembler you can pass an argument no 
 `--no-sim`. Similarly if you only wish to evaluate your simulator you can use `--no-asm`
